# TypeScript - DesignPatterns

This repository contains the implementation of the design patterns using **TypeScript**.
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in code.

## Benefits of Design Patterns

1. **Reusability**: Design patterns promote code reusability by providing well-proven solutions to recurring design problems. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time, you can apply these patterns to solve similar problems in your projects.

2. **Maintainability**: By following design patterns, you can create more maintainable and organized code which makes it easier to understand, modify, and extend the software in the future.

3. **Collaboration**: Design patterns offer a common language and framework for communication among developers. When everyone on a team is familiar with these patterns, it becomes easier to discuss and implement solutions collaboratively.

4. **Performance**: Some design patterns can help improve the performance and efficiency of your software. For example, the Singleton pattern ensures there is only one instance of a class, which can be crucial for resource-intensive objects.

5. **Problem-solving**: Design patterns provide tested solutions to known design problems, allowing you to focus on solving higher-level and domain-specific challenges in your software.

6. **Best Practices**: Learning design patterns exposes you to best practices in software design. This knowledge can help you make informed decisions about architecture, design, and code organization in your projects.

7. **Career Advancement**: Knowing and using design patterns is a valuable skill in the software development industry. Employers often look for developers who understand these patterns, as they can produce more reliable and maintainable code.

8. **Design Flexibility**: Design patterns help you create flexible software that can adapt to changing requirements. This adaptability is essential in modern software development, where change is a constant factor.

9. **Problem Recognition**: Understanding design patterns helps you recognize when a particular problem can be solved using a well-established pattern. This can save you time and effort when designing your software.

10. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Some design patterns are platform-agnostic and can be applied to different programming languages and environments, making your knowledge transferable.

11. **Code Quality**: Applying design patterns often leads to cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable code, which contributes to the overall quality of your software.

## Classification of patterns

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed.

> The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms.
> They usually apply only to a single programming language.
> The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns.

Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language.
Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.
In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose.

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
